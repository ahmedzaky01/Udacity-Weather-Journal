# Udacity-Weather-Journal

### Overview
This project from Udacity Nano Degree asks you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API from open weather and user data to dynamically update the UI for the client to see the reflected changes.
### Setup
I used Node and packages (express, cors and body-parser) which are used to create the server.
